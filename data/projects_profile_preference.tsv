I have been presenting the slide deck for the Investment and Operating platform as well as the strategy. Part of the platform requires the prospective investor to provide working capital in exchange for a fixed percentage interest in the Operating Platform, as well as providing Investment Capital for the GP portion of the prospective real estate investments.Several potential investors have expressed interest, but need to better understand the Operating Platform's budget and how they, the investor gets paid back both the operating capital and their GP investment capital.I am looking for someone to provide analytical support to build a dynamic Excel model which shows the working capital budget over 5 yrs. Part of the complexity of this model lies in the fact that the revenue and expenses related to model scale upwards as we are successful in acquiring new properties. So, simultaneous to running a revenue/expense model for the business platform, we have to overlay assumptions and hypothetical CF's from the prospective investments.Each investment will provide a series of fees to the Operating platform (i.e. acquisition, property management, etc...) that will offset the ""burn"" of the investors working capital draw from the investor. The investor's working capital will also be paid back as part of the ""waterfall"" of distributions to the GP (specifics to be provided).The model needs to be dynamic in the sense that we may have to vary the the assumptions of how many acquisitions are made per year, and how at what point does the business grow from an initial team of 3 to more,,,We will provide a basic Property Level acquisition template, but the fees from the Property will feed into the working capital budget.Because of the nature of the sensitivity of the project, its key members, its operating and investment strategy, you will be required to execute a Confidentiality Agreement before engaging in the assignment."

For example, a pump supplies high pressure hydraulic fluid to a hydraulic cylinder, whichextends the cylinder, which lifts the bed of a dump truck so the truck can dump out its payload. The hydraulic fluid can become contaminated withgas/air bubbles as the fluid changes pressure. In the past, thisequipment used large hydraulic fluid tanks. These tanks were so large that the buoyancy of these air bubbles allowed them to be removed from the fluid within the tank. Today, construction equipment manufacturers are moving to smaller tanks to save on fuel economy, increase the payload of their equipment, and save on the cost of oil changes.These small tanksdo not allow air bubbles to escape, which is causing problems for equipment controls and component life in this equipment.The purpose of this work is to understand the value of shrinking the hydraulic fluid tank size in mobile construction equipment. Are there specific vehicles or enginesizes where this is more of a concern? Who are the OEM's that are concerned with this issue? What are the current solutions being implemented? What are the customer complaints around hydraulic fluid aeration in these vehicles? Which other vehicle marketsdoor could have this same issue (Agg, Mining, Forestry, etc.)?We would like to get answers to these questions through customer interviews of 20 end users and7 OEMs in the United States.

HMC has been in existencefor nearly 6 years and released the first product, the Indego exoskeleton, in late 2015 marketed toneuro-rehabilitation clinics for gait training and to severely impaired paraplegics for use in their homeand community. The Indego Nomad product istargeted to a much larger and varied population than the original Indego Personal, it will have a muchmore demanding usage case and will be fitted by a well established channel of Orthotics & Prostheticsclinical practices. As such, HMC business and engineering leadership would like to ensure that IndegoNomad reliability and durability in the field exceeds the expectations and usage of all clinicians, endusers/patients and payers. HMC would like to engage a durability/reliability expert to act as anindependent reviewer of the analyses, design and methods the HMC team employ to ensure thedurability/reliability of the Indego Nomad device. The expert would also provide recommendations onhow to improve analysis, design, testing, and operations of the product in order to optimize durabilityand reliability. The key activities and deliverables of the product reliability/durability advisory support are as follows: 1. Familiarization with Indego Nomad product concept, marketing requirements, specifications anddevelopment completed thus far. This will include communications with our marketing andclinical team to understand the targeted populations (spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis,stroke, etc.) and their variability/heterogeneity in terms of device performance requirements. This phase will also include communications with our engineering team to gain familiarization with the design of the physical device hardware and circuitry.2. Independent reliability review of the product design, including review of the product hardware, circuitry; applying prediction, estimation and apportionment methodologies; DFMEA review; planning and analysis of reliability testing and field failures, including mathematical/statistical modeling; human factors analysis; resulting in a report including: a. Summary of mathematical modeling; Design review findings and recommendations on how to improve the DFMEA and design changes to prevent failures in the field b. Identification of key technology and process risks c. Reliability-based Recommendations on how to mitigate identified key risks, through cycle and clinicaltesting, etc (including confidence interval vs. testing cost tradeoffs and options) 3. Independent review of Validation & Verification (V&V) plan, especially as it relates to durabilityand reliability, developed by the engineering team, and development of a report withrecommendations for improvement The timing of this independent product reliability/durability review will be determined by the overallIndego Nomad project development timeline (see attached).
